# Track Map

Track Map helps you capture track notes in a digital way, so you can improve your driving faster. For each turn you can say whether you had oversteer or understeer, and write some thoughts on best way to approach it, braking points, etc. The project is at early beta so expect bare minimum functionality and things to not work at all! Use at your own risk.

## Getting started

If you have trouble with `createRequire is not a function`, try upgrading your node version. E.g. 14.17.3 should work.

## Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
